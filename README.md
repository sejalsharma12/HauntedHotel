# HauntedHotel
Our game consists of a player gathering keys to escape the haunted hotel. In order to gather these keys, the player will complete various tasks in 3 thrilling levels with a limited number of lives. The player will be given 3 lives at the start of each level, and there will be obstacles such as poisonous drinks or green goblins that may cause the player to lose a life. The player must complete all the levels without running out of lives to escape the haunted hotel.

In the first level, the player is tasked with collecting objects to clean up a mysterious bloody mess on the bathroom floor. Prior to cleaning the mess, they will need to obtain 3 cleaning supplies -  a mop, cleaning solution, and a bucket. After collecting all the items, the player obtains a key and can then travel to the next room to clean the mess. After cleaning up the mess, the player obtains another key to move to the next level.

In the second level, the player will need to find the unpoisoned drink from a set of 4 bottles to obtain the key to the next level. In order to identify the correct drink, they will need to solve a math problem. If the player drinks a poisoned drink, they will lose a life. After successfully finding the unpoisoned drink, the player obtains the key to move to the final level.

In the final level the player has to navigate a maze to escape the hotel. Within the maze, there will be several goblin enemies roaming around. Colliding with an enemy will cause the player to lose a life and make the path smokey and hard to see. The game is completed when the player finds the exit to the maze.
